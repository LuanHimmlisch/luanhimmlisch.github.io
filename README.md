# Luan Himmlisch Frontend and Game developer

Hello! I'm Luan Himmlisch, a frontend and game developer. I like to make unique pages, focusing on the design and accesibility. 

## Flavor up your websites!

Nowadays many websites look the same, everyone tries to replicate well stablished designs and at the end everything looks boring. I'm against that, I believe the web is a not only an expression of great technology and logic but also **creativity**. And thus, we as web developers need to extend that expression to all sites we create, even corporative pages could use some little **CSS magic**.

## Source of creativity

I code thanks to videogames and from a young age I learned to create them. I love the process of picturing something and then making it real. 

I am before anything, a Game developer. My projects are made with a game designer mentallity and an UX developer awareness, I want everyone to experience what I create.
